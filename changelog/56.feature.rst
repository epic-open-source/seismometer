- Updates the Seismogram class constructor to take precisely a DataLoader and a ConfigProvider, improving separation between the class and configuration loading.
- Adds a post-load hook for modifying the otherwise ready dataframe.  This hook is not accessible via normal run_startup, and requires direct initialization of Seismogram.
