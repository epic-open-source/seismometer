    "Geology is the scientific study of the Earth, including its composition, structure, and history. It examines the rocks, minerals, and processes that shape our planet. One fascinating aspect of geology is the study of earthquakes, which are natural phenomena characterized by the shaking of the Earth's crust. Earthquakes occur due to the movement of tectonic plates, and they can have significant impacts on the environment and human society.\n"

    "Earthquakes are typically caused by the release of accumulated stress along faults in the Earth's crust. When the stress exceeds the strength of the rocks, it results in the sudden release of energy, leading to seismic waves that propagate through the Earth. These waves cause the ground to shake, and the severity of shaking depends on factors such as the magnitude of the earthquake and the distance from the epicenter.\n"

By default, the majority group is the baseline and a statistic for all observations in the other groups is compared. A fairness threshold such as 125% is then used to classify the ratio of each group to the reference.  If any group performs differently, above (125% in our example) or below (80%) then it is considered a failure for that cohort+metric.  \n",

    "    - This plot can help you assess both in aggregate and at specific thresholds how often the model correctly identifies positive cases and negative cases. The AUROC or C-stat is the area under the ROC curve is a single measure of how well the model performs across thresholds.\n",
    "2. (Top-middle) This curve plots the sensitivity and flag rate across all possible thresholds for the model. \n",
    "    - This plot can help you determine how frequently your model would trigger workflow interventions at different thresholds, and how many of those interventions would be taken for true positive cases. The highlighted area above the curve indicates how many true positives would be missed at this threshold.\n",
    "3. (Top-right) The calibration curve is a measure of how reliable a model is in its predictions at a given threshold. \n",

    "    - Points above the line `y=x` line indicate that a model is *overconfident* in its predictions (i.e. identifying more positive cases than exist), and points below the `y=x` line indicate that a model is *underconfident* in its predictions (i.e. identifying fewer positive cases than exist).\n",

    "    - This plot is useful for identifying thresholds where your model has high enough specificity, sensitivity, and PPV for your intended workflows.\n",
