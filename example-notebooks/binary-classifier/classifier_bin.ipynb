    "## Fairness Audit\n",
    "It is important to note that decisions on which fairness metrics are applicable to a model should be made with deep knowledge of how the model is used and then interpreted carefully.  Even when a metric is flagged as failing, there may be context that explains and even predicts the difference, so generally warrants some attention and not necessarily exposes a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is mathematically impossible to ensure parity across many definitions simultaneously, so focus on a predetermined set and an awareness of the others is an observed strategy.  \n",
    "Like many concepts, a single parity concept can have several different names; notable parity of true positive rate is equal opportunity, parity of false positive rate is predictive equality, and parity of predictive prevalence is demographic parity.\n",
    "\n",
    "An [Aequitas audit](https://dssg.github.io/aequitas/) gives an overview of parity across all defined groups for each cohort attribute.  By default, the majority group is the baseline and a statistic for all observations in the other groups is compared. A fairness threshold such as 125% is then used to classify the ratio of each group to the reference.  If any group performs differently, above (125% in our example) or below (80%) then it is considered a failure for that cohort+metric.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization is a table showing the overall pass/fail, an ordered list of circles representing the groups, and a bar representing the percentage of the population data in reference.  Note that comparison across columns is not always exact due to potential differences in the included observations from missing information. Hovering over a bar or dot will give details on the group and metric.\n"

    "    - This plot can help you assess both in aggregate and at specific thresholds how often the model correctly identifies positive cases and negative cases. The AUROC or C-stat is the area under the ROC curve is a single measure of how well the model performs across thresholds.\n",
    "2. (Top-middle) This curve plots the sensitivity and flag rate across all possible thresholds for the model. \n",
    "    - This plot can help you determine how frequently your model would trigger workflow interventions at different thresholds, and how many of those interventions would be taken for true positive cases. The highlighted area above the curve indicates how many true positives would be missed at this threshold.\n",
    "3. (Top-right) The calibration curve is a measure of how reliable a model is in its predictions at a given threshold. \n",
    "    - This plots the observed rate (what proportion of cases at that threshold are true positives) against the model's predicted probability.\n",
    "    - Points above the line `y=x` line indicate that a model is *overconfident* in its predictions (i.e., identifying more positive cases than exist), and points below the `y=x` line indicate that a model is *underconfident* in its predictions (i.e. identifying fewer positive cases than exist).\n",

    "    - The curve shows precision and recall across all possible thresholds for the model. This plot can help you assess the tradeoffs between identifying more positive cases, and correctly identifying positive cases. \n",
    "5. (Bottom-middle) This plot shows the sensitivity, specificity, and PPV across all possible thresholds for a model. \n",
    "    - This plot is useful for identifying thresholds where your model has high enough specificity, sensitivity, and PPV for your intended workflows.\n",
    "6. (Bottom-right) This plot shows the predicted probabilities for entities in the dataset stratified by whether or not they met the target criteria. \n",
