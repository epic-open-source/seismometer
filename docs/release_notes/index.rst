- Exclude time columns from ydata-profiling. (`#88 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/88>`__)

0.2.1
-----

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add number needed to treat (NNT) with fixed rho=1/3 and net benefit, from med_metrics package. (`#78 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/78>`__)


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Warning message on censored cohorts is coerced to string before logging. (`#65 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/65>`__)
- Log a warning if cohort source column is not found in the dataframe. (`#67 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/67>`__)
- Improved support for datasets with a large number of cohort columns. Allowing row wrapping of cohort selection. (`#70 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/70>`__)
- Improved the Fairness audit iframe support by increasing the height a bit to account for cohort error messages. (`#70 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/70>`__)
- Allow long filenames by hashing the ends, this fix allow large cohort selection lists when creating reports and fairness audits which are cached to disk. (`#70 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/70>`__)
- Handle merging without context id; assumes events dataframe columns. (`#71 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/71>`__)
- Simplify merge logic for the single 'first' strategy. This removes coalecsing logic by assuming an event type always has times (or never does). (`#72 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/72>`__)
- Hardens restriction of events (with times) to occur after prediction time + window offset, not having the unintuitive partial information for early, late, and unknown timings. (`#72 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/72>`__)


Improved Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updated integration_guide/index.rst to add a table documenting examples from the Seismometer Community of open source tools that are compatible/integrated with Seismometer. (`#74 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/74>`__)


0.2.0
-----

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Changed box and whisker plots to violin plots (`#36 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/36>`__)
- Added Exploration controls to allow setting dynamic values for thresholds, targets, outcomes, etc. (`#41 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/41>`__)

- Modify the accessors of ConfigProvider.events to return a dictionaries of events instead of a list. (`#48 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/48>`__)
- Update model and cohort performance plots to respect the aggregation_method: supports max (default), min, first and last. (`#48 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/48>`__)
- Configuration now supports multiple event types as the source for a single event. Values for the source events are assumed to be compatible, like both being Boolean. (`#54 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/54>`__)
- Updates the Seismogram class constructor to take precisely a DataLoader and a ConfigProvider, improving separation between the class and configuration loading. (`#56 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/56>`__)
- Adds a post-load hook for modifying the otherwise ready dataframe.  This hook is not accessible via normal run_startup, and requires direct initialization of Seismogram. (`#56 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/56>`__)
