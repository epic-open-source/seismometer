-----

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Changed box and whisker plots to violin plots (`#36 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/36>`__)
- Added Exploration controls to allow setting dynamic values for thresholds, targets, outcomes, etc. (`#41 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/41>`__)
- Add an optional aggregation_method to event objects of usage_config. (`#48 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/48>`__)
- Modify the accessors of ConfigProvider.events to return a dictionaries of events instead of a list. (`#48 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/48>`__)
- Update model and cohort performance plots to respect the aggregation_method: supports max (default), min, first and last. (`#48 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/48>`__)
- Configuration now supports multiple event types as the source for a single event. Values for the source events are assumed to be compatible, like both being Boolean. (`#54 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/54>`__)
- Updates the Seismogram class constructor to take precisely a DataLoader and a ConfigProvider, improving separation between the class and configuration loading. (`#56 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/56>`__)
- Adds a post-load hook for modifying the otherwise ready dataframe.  This hook is not accessible via normal run_startup, and requires direct initialization of Seismogram. (`#56 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/56>`__)

- Added DiskCachedFunction to allow disk caching of HTML content (`#28 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/28>`__)
- Restructures Seismogram load to allow prioritizing in memory dataframe over loading predictions and/or events. (`#20 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/20>`__)
- seismometer.run_startup() can now accept preloaded prediction and event dataframes that take precendence over loading from configuration (`#34 <https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer/issues/34>`__)
