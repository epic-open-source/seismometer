Contributing to Seismometer
===========================

Contributing to ``seismometer`` is similar to
other open-source repositories.

-  Small bug fixes can be validated with automated testing and accepted
   easily.

-  You can contribute new notebooks without substantial technical
   knowledge, which allows you to contribute new guidelines and processes
   for model validation.

-  Enhancements to ``seismometer`` undergo thorough scrutiny by maintainers.

Contributors must agree to our contributor license agreement, and your
request will undergo internal review to determine if the request is
palatable and high-quality.

Contributors must also adhere to our code of conduct which can be reviewed at 
`Code of Conduct`_.

Contributors must fork our repository and make pull requests to it with
their changes. These pull requests will go through an internal review by
at least two Epic software development staff before being accepted.

Epic Contributor License Agreement
----------------------------------

When you contribute to our project, you are agreeing to our Contributor
License Agreement (the “CLA” or the “Agreement”).

When you agree to this CLA, you are agreeing on your own behalf. If
applicable, you should discuss with your employer before agreeing to
this CLA, because some employers may have restrictions on your
contributions to other projects. You are entering this Agreement as an
individual, and you represent that you are legally entitled to grant the
licenses contemplated in this Agreement. If your employer(s) has rights
to intellectual property that you create, such as your contributions,
you represent that you have received permission to make contributions on
behalf of that employer or that your employer has waived such rights for
your contributions to Epic projects.

Epic Systems Corporation (“Epic”) - Contributor License Agreement
(“Agreement”) V1.0

(Based on the Apache Software Foundation Individual Contributor License
Agreement V2.2 available at https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf)

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your
present and future Contributions submitted to Epic. Except for the
license granted herein to Epic and recipients of software distributed by
Epic, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your
Contributions.

1. **Definitions**

   “You” (or “Your”) shall mean the owner of the Contribution or legal
   entity authorized by the owner of the Contribution that is making
   this Agreement with Epic. For legal entities, the entity making a
   Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by,
   or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a
   single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, “control”
   means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
   management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii)
   ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares,
   or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   “Contribution” shall mean any original work of authorship, including
   any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is
   intentionally submitted by You to Epic for inclusion in, or
   documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Epic (the
   “Work”). For the purposes of this definition, “submitted” means any
   form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Epic or
   its representatives, including but not limited to communication on
   electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue
   tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Epic for the
   purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
   communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in
   writing by You as “Not a Contribution.”

2. **Grant of Copyright License.** Subject to the terms and conditions
   of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Epic and to recipients of
   software distributed by Epic a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
   no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce,
   prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
   sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative
   works.

3. **Grant of Patent License.** Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this Agreement, You hereby grant to Epic and to recipients of
   software distributed by Epic a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
   no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
   section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
   import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies
   only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily
   infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your
   Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
   submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or
   any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
   lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you
   have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent
   infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under
   this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of
   the date such litigation is filed.

4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above
   license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that
   you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you
   have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that
   employer or that your employer has waived such rights for your
   Contributions to Epic.

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
   creation. You represent that Your Contributions include complete
   details of any third-party license or other restriction (including,
   but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are
   personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your
   Contributions.

6. You represent that Your Contributions do not contain malware
   (including viruses) or other malicious code (such as Trojan horses,
   worms, or other code with nefarious purposes).

7. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
   except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide
   support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by
   applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your
   Contributions on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
   OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
   limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
   MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

8. You agree to notify Epic of any facts or circumstances of which you
   become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any
   respect.
